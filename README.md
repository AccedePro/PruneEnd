# PruneEnd
Just a simple Python script to automatically delete end region files.

This script deletes all region files that contain the outer end islands and is designed for survival servers where regeneration is neccessary for all players to access good loot. It is suited to a fairly used survival server. 

Xisumavoid covered this technique in one of his videos:

This is a lightweight program that automates the deletion process.
